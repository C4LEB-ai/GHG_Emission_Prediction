# GHG Emission Prediction from Solar Power Plants


## Introduction/Objective
This project focuses on predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from solar power plants using a machine learning approach. Solar power plants, while a renewable energy source, still have an associated environmental impact due to their operations. Understanding and predicting the GHG emissions is essential for environmental impact assessments, policy-making, and optimizing the performance of renewable energy systems.


The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the GHG emissions based on these operational characteristics.

## Methodology
To achieve the objective of accurately predicting GHG emissions, the following methodology is employed:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship between variables.
   - Handling missing values, if any, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Identifying the most significant features that contribute to GHG emissions prediction.
   - Techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance ranking are utilized.

3. **Model Development**
   - Several machine learning models are implemented, including:
     - **Random Forest Regressor**
     - **Gradient Boosting**
     - **Linear Regression**
   - These models are trained on the dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (GHG emissions).

4. **Model Evaluation and Validation**
   - The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others.
   - Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure the models are robust and reliable.
   - Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize model performance.
